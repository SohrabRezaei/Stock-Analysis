# VBA_Challenge
## Overview of Project
Refactoring the module 2 original code in order to run the VBA codes faster. Refactoring helps to remove excessive codes and repition while occupying less space to deliver a better result. The original code used a [for](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/fornext-statement) loop to loop through the tickers, whereas it is also possible to introduce a set of variables which are arrays to loop the tickers.
